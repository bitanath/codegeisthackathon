# Codegeist Submission - Junebug for JIRA and Bitbucket
basically an app that makes security issues easier to recgnize and fix using OpenAI's Chat GPT. Also includes custom TF 2.0 model for identifying privacy issues in image files.

### How to install ###
Use the following links:
- For Bitbucket https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/e0ef1943-9d99-406a-b56a-b41613c602d1/distribution
- For JIRA https://developer.atlassian.com/console/myapps/11fdb82a-3f26-43ca-8ea0-782500549473/distribution

Then just open any repository and watch as it scans in the background and comes up with security vulnerabilities. JIRAs can be created and commits are automatically linked.
