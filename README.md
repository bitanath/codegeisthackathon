This lets you see all JIRAs that have been created using the app.

### How to use ###
Install the apps for JIRA and Bitbucket, create your repository on Bitbucket, and link a project on JIRA. Then just open any repository and watch as it scans in the background and comes up with security vulnerabilities. JIRAs can be created directly from the app and commits are automatically linked to the JIRAs.
